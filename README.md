⚙️ Technology Stack
Below is a list of core technologies used in this project, along with their purpose and role in the application architecture:

🐍 Django
Purpose:
A high-level Python web framework used to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications. It provides built-in features for rapid development, including authentication, routing, and ORM for database interaction.

🐘 PostgreSQL
Purpose:
An open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured data in the project. It is known for reliability, robustness, and advanced features such as indexing and transactions.

🔍 GraphQL
Purpose:
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Used in this project to provide efficient and flexible API endpoints compared to traditional REST.

🌐 HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Purpose:
Used for building the frontend user interface. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity to the pages.

⚛️ React (if applicable)
Purpose:
A JavaScript library used to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It enables the creation of reusable UI components and efficient state management on the client side.

🐳 Docker
Purpose:
Used to containerize the application for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments. Ensures the application runs the same across different machines.

🧪 Pytest / Postman / Swagger (if applicable)
Purpose:
Tools for testing the backend API. Pytest is used for unit tests, Postman for manual API testing, and Swagger for API documentation and interactive exploration.


🗃️ Database Design
The project is built on a relational database model with key entities representing the core functionality of the platform. Below is an overview of each entity, its main fields, and the relationships between them.

1. 👤 Users
Represents all registered users on the platform.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier for the user

username: User’s login name

email: User’s contact email

password_hash: Encrypted password

role: Indicates if the user is a guest, host, or admin

2. 🏠 Properties
Represents listings available for booking.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier for the property

title: Name of the property

description: Detailed description

location: Address or city of the property

owner_id: Foreign key referencing the Users table

Relationship:
A user (host) can have multiple properties.

3. 📅 Bookings
Captures reservations made by users.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier for the booking

user_id: Foreign key referencing the Users table

property_id: Foreign key referencing the Properties table

check_in: Start date of the stay

check_out: End date of the stay

Relationship:
A booking belongs to one user and one property.

4. 📝 Reviews
Stores feedback submitted by users after a stay.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier for the review

user_id: Foreign key referencing the Users table

property_id: Foreign key referencing the Properties table

rating: Numeric rating score

comment: Textual feedback

Relationship:
A user can leave multiple reviews, each for a specific property.

5. 💳 Payments
Handles payment transactions for bookings.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier for the payment

booking_id: Foreign key referencing the Bookings table

amount: Total cost of the booking

payment_method: Type of payment (e.g., card, mobile money)

payment_status: Status (e.g., paid, pending, failed)

Relationship:
Each payment is tied to one booking.

🔗 Entity Relationships Summary
A User can own multiple Properties.

A User can make multiple Bookings.

A Booking is linked to one Property and one User.

A User can leave Reviews on multiple Properties.

Each Booking has one Payment.


🔐 API Security
Securing our backend APIs is a top priority to protect user data, prevent misuse, and ensure safe transactions. Below are the key security measures implemented in this project and why they are essential.

1. Authentication
What it does:
Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints by validating user credentials via secure tokens (e.g., JWT).

Why it’s important:
Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.

2. Authorization
What it does:
Controls what authenticated users can do—e.g., only property owners can edit or delete their listings.

Why it’s important:
Protects resources from being accessed or modified by users without the right permissions.

3. Rate Limiting
What it does:
Restricts the number of API requests a user or IP address can make in a given time window.

Why it’s important:
Prevents abuse such as brute force attacks and API spamming.

4. Data Validation & Sanitization
What it does:
Checks all incoming request data for correctness and removes potentially harmful input.

Why it’s important:
Prevents injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) that could compromise system integrity.

5. HTTPS Encryption
What it does:
Ensures all data transmitted between client and server is encrypted using SSL/TLS.

Why it’s important:
Protects sensitive data (e.g., login credentials, payment info) from being intercepted over the network.

6. Secure Payment Processing
What it does:
Integrates secure third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) with strong encryption and tokenization.

Why it’s important:
Ensures users’ financial details are handled safely and not stored insecurely.

7. Logging and Monitoring
What it does:
Tracks API access and system events for unusual or suspicious activity.

Why it’s important:
Helps in early detection of security breaches or attempted attacks.

🧩 Why Security Matters
🛡️ User Data Protection: Secure handling of personal data builds user trust and complies with data protection regulations.

💰 Payment Security: Prevents financial fraud and protects both users and platform owners.

🏗️ System Integrity: Stops attackers from exploiting the system or compromising core functionalities.

🚫 Abuse Prevention: Rate limiting and monitoring help mitigate denial-of-service attacks and misuse of platform features.
